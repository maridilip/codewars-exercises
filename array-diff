/*

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]

If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]

*/

function array_diff(a, b) {
var res=[];
  for(var i=0;i<a.length;i++){
    if(b.indexOf(a[i])==-1){
      //a.splice(i,1);
      res.push(a[i]);
    }
  }
  return res;
}
